\maketitle

We first create some abbreviations.
% Create some abbreviation macros
\begin{verbatim}
\newabbrev{SME}{Small and Medium-sized Enterprise}
\newabbrev[randd]{R\&D}{Research \& Development}
\newabbrev{OECD}{Organisational for 
        Economic and Cooperation Development}
\newfullabbrev{AS}{Autonomous System}{ASes}{ASes}{}
\end{verbatim}
\newabbrev{SME}{Small and Medium-sized Enterprise}
\newabbrev[randd]{R\&D}{Research \& Development}
\newabbrev{OECD}{Organisational for Economic and Cooperation Development}
\newfullabbrev{AS}{Autonomous System}{ASes}{ASes}{}

% This macro will not be used and hence will not appear in the list of abbreviations.

First occurrences of the abbreviations will be expanded, for example \verb|\SMEs| gives \SMEs, \verb|\randd| gives \randd, and \verb|\ASes| gives \ASes.

Subsequent occurrences of the macros will be abbreviated, such as \verb|\SME| gives \SME and, and \verb|\randds| gives \randds, and \verb|\AS| gives \AS.

The abbreviations can be \emph{reset} using \verb|\resetabbrev|.
\resetabbrev

Afterwards, the behaviours of the abbreviations macros will be such that they have never been used.

First occurrences of the abbreviations will be expanded, for example \verb|\SMEs| gives \SMEs, \verb|\randd| gives \randd, and \verb|\ASes| gives \ASes.

Subsequent occurrences of the macros will be abbreviated, such as \verb|\SME| gives \SME and, and \verb|\randds| gives \randds, and \verb|\AS| gives \AS.
 
Abbreviation can be reset \emph{individually}, e.g., \verb|\resetabbrev[SME]| reset \verb|\SME| command.
\resetabbrev[SME]

See that \verb|\SMEs| is now fully expanded as \SMEs, but \verb|\randds| is still abbreviated as \randds and \verb|\AS| is still abbreviated as \AS.

The list of abbreviations can be printed.  Only the used abbreviations will be added to the list. Notice that \verb|OECD| is not in the list.
